SafeWalk
SafeWalk is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to enhance personal safety by connecting users with volunteer escorts for their walking trips. The app allows users to input their start and end locations, visualizes the route on a map, and automatically assigns available volunteers to accompany them.
Key Features:

Real-time location tracking and mapping using OpenStreetMap
Firebase integration for user data and trip management
Automated volunteer assignment system
Push notifications for trip updates and volunteer assignments
User-friendly interface for inputting trip details

Technologies Used:

Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
Firebase (Realtime Database, Firestore, Cloud Messaging)

HTTP for API requests

SafeWalk aims to create a safer community by leveraging technology to connect those who need accompaniment with willing volunteers. Whether it's a late-night walk home or a journey through an unfamiliar area, SafeWalk provides peace of mind and promotes community engagement.
